# Wordy
A word puzzle game for DOS

Wordy is a word puzzle game for DOS. You have six attempts to guess the mystery five-letter word.
After each guess, the game highlights your letters:
black if that letter does not exist in the mystery word,
orange if the letter exists but not in that location,
green if the letter exists in that location.

*Make a guess*

This is a *demo* program for my YouTube channel.
It is a functional game, but it does not pick a random word from a dictionary of possible five-letter words.
